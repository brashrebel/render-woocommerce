# Render Woocommerce

Love Woocommerce? So do we. Woocommerce is a powerful plugin which allows you to easily sell digital products
through WordPress.

One powerful part of Woocommerce is the 13 shortcodes included in the plugin. These shortcodes make it possible to place
Woocommerce related content such as specific downloads, login forms, pricing, receipts, purchase links and more. But, like
all shortcodes, they are not easy to use. Shortcodes require you to learn the basic shortcode syntax, to refer to
developer documentation (if available) to learn available parameters and to preview your posts to see if they even
work.

That's where Render comes in. Render is a plugin for WordPress which creates an intuitive interface for finding
and adding shortcodes into your content without ever seeing the code or referring to documentation. In addition,
all supported shortcodes will generate a live preview in your editor so you'll never actually see the [shortcode]
syntax at all but instead, the content you actually care about.
